compare-two-images
==================

a program in Java that compares any 2 images and shows the differences visually


This is a program in Java that compares any 2 images and shows the differences visually.
 Implementation use only standard JDK features, no 3rd party libraries. 
Pixels (with the same coordinates in two images)may be visually similar,
 but have different values of RGB. We mark pixel as "different" if difference between 
them is more than 10%. Differences are shown as a generated output image with different 
regions highlighted in red.

1. First locate a JPEG image in apropriate folder on your disc.
2. Make a copy this file and locate this copy in this folder.
3. Paint samething on second image by Paint or other programm.
4. Make sure that these two files have same size.
5. If paint programm change size of one of the pictures - 
open other file in this paint programm and just save it in this programm, that size of images
will be same or nearly same.

Thanks a lot.
